# 🎮 Meteor Shooter Game 🚀

Welcome to **Meteor Shooter**! This is a classic arcade-style game where you control a neon blue gun and shoot at falling meteors. The bigger the meteor, the more points you score! Watch out, though—miss too many meteors, and the game will end!

## 🎯 How to Play

1. **Move Left/Right**: Use the arrow keys to move your gun left or right.
2. **Shoot**: Press the SPACE bar to fire bullets at the meteors.
3. **Score Points**: Destroy meteors to score points. Bigger meteors give you more points!
4. **Avoid Misses**: Try not to let too many meteors fall past the bottom of the screen. Miss 10 meteors, and it’s game over!

## 🌟 Features

- **Neon Blue Gun**: A cool, retro-inspired gun to shoot with.
- **Different Meteor Sizes**: Bigger meteors mean more points!
- **Score System**: Keep track of your score and aim for high scores!
